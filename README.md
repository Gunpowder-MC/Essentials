# Essentials for Fabric

Essentials for Fabric aims to port the popular "Essentials" plugin to Fabric, as well as adding features from other plugins and QoL changes, to provide an all-in-one mod for your server's needs.

Essentials for Fabric is easily extendable using the api module, which is made available on curseforge. A maven may be created if deemed necessary.
